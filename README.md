# Leanpub Translations

If you want to help us localize Leanpub to your language, please fork this repo and then make a pull request.

Not all of Leanpub is internationalized, so not all of Leanpub can be localized.  For now, the goal is for reader-facing stuff in the checkout workflow to be internationalized and localized.

Every language we support has a 2 letter code YAML file for that language.  We support English, plus languages that have been volunteer-translated to a good level by an interested author.

To localize Leanpub to a your language or to fix an issue with our existing localization to your language, please do the following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. If you are adding a new language, please create a new language file with a file extension of .yml.  The best thing to do is to start either with the en.yml or a specific translation such as fr.yml or de.yml. The filename should be the two letter code at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
3. Make the changes you wish.
4. Submit a pull request for us.

Please email hello@leanpub.com if you have any questions!

Thanks!

The Leanpub Team
